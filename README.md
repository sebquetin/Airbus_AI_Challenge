# Airbus_AI_Challenge
Airbus AI Anomaly Detection challenge 2020 in partnership with INSA Toulouse. The goal of the challenge was to predict anomalies in mutli variate time series in a semi-supervised setting. We had what we could call "normal time series", we had to learn the normality. The second step was : from new data composed of normal and abnormal signals, identify the anomalies.
